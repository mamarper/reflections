When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working on a team project or when you want to share your project with others so they can collaborate. Or maybe because you are working from different computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because you may be trying some new features or fixing bugs on your local repository before pushing them to the remote. In that case, you may want to create a different branch and merge them when ready.
